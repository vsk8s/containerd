Description: open and reliable container runtime
 Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for
 Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container life cycle of
 its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and
 supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 Containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than
 being used directly by developers or end-users.
 .
 This package contains the binaries.
 .
 Note: docker.io package contains its own containerd binary, located at
 /usr/bin/docker-containerd. You don't need this containerd package
 if you only need to use docker.
